I am Carlo Cannarsa. I work as a **Security Engineer** @ Leonardo.

![Me](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bMtwHLaSL.jpg)

I have a MSc **Cybersecurity** and a bachelor's in **Computer Engineering**, my passion is software security and engineering. I am also a self-learner, and I like to keep up with this field by staying updated and discovering new things.

My main hobby is **photography**, especially street photos. During my free time or my trips I take a lot of photos. Here's a photo of mine at Karl's Bridge @ Praga:

I recently have adopted a cat and I'm now a **cat person**. I love cats. They're, just, *fabolous*.

I am Italian and my favourite dish is *Pasta all'Assassina*. Check it out if you don't know it, it's delicious.
